Attendance Entry Quick Buttons Pluging for PowerSchool Admin Portal

Description
This plugin adds "Current Time" and Start/End of Day buttons to the "New/Edit Daily Attendance Time" page.  The "Current Time" button populates the associated input box with the current time of the user's computer.  The "Start/End of Day" buttons rely of the "Default Time In/Out" values of the Bell Bell Schedule Item for which the "Use For Daily Attendance" checkbox is checked.
